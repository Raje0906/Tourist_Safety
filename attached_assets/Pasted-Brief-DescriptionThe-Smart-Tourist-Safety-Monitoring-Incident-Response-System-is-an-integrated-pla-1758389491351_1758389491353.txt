Generate a seamless animated background for a professional and modern website. The background should feature soft, flowing abstract shapes with smooth transitions and gradients that blend deep blue, indigo, violet, and teal tones. The animation should be subtle, creating a sense of depth and movement without drawing attention away from the main content.

Include softly glowing particles or dots that drift gently across the screen, moving slowly in random directions to add life and dynamism. The particles should have low opacity and subtle light trails, as if floating in a calm atmosphere.

Incorporate layered translucent waveforms or curves that overlap and fade into each other, creating depth and fluid motion. These shapes should softly pulse and change opacity as they move, without sharp edges or abrupt changes.

Add ambient lighting effects like soft glows and diffused highlights around shapes, giving the impression of soft illumination. Avoid harsh contrasts – instead, aim for a smooth, soothing gradient effect that feels clean and futuristic.

The motion should be continuous, looped seamlessly, and slow-paced to maintain a relaxing experience. Avoid sudden jumps or flickers.

The overall mood should evoke trust, calmness, and innovation – suitable for a healthcare, AI-driven, or wellness-related website. The design must look modern, minimalistic, and user-friendly, appealing to tech-savvy audiences while maintaining accessibility and visual comfort.

Optional elements: – Floating lines or curves with soft light glows that occasionally ripple. – Particle clusters that gently form and disperse. – Smooth gradient transitions from dark corners to soft light areas to add visual depth.”

Design and develop a professional, secure, and user-friendly website for a Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System. The website must feature role-based access and distinct experiences for tourists and admins, with the following functionalities:

1. Landing/Login Page

The first screen must be a login page that welcomes users with a clean, modern interface.

Provide two login options:

Continue with Google – for tourist login only.

Hardcoded admin login – two predefined admin accounts that allow direct access to the admin dashboard. The system must automatically detect the role based on the credentials entered and direct the user accordingly.

The design should clearly distinguish between tourist and admin login paths without cluttering the interface.

Include secure authentication, visually intuitive buttons, and a minimalist layout with appropriate animations or transitions.

2. Role Detection & Routing

On login, the system must:

Detect if the user is an admin by verifying against hardcoded credentials.

If the user is an admin, redirect them to the Admin Dashboard.

If the user is a tourist, redirect them to the Tourist Registration Page.

Ensure that the role is stored securely in session or token-based authentication to prevent unauthorized access to the wrong dashboard.

3. Tourist Registration Page

Once a tourist logs in, the first page they see should prompt them to register by creating a Blockchain-based Digital Tourist ID.

Features required in the registration form:

Personal details like name, phone number, email, etc.

KYC documents (upload Aadhaar or passport).

Trip itinerary, emergency contact details.

Location preferences or travel history for risk assessment.

The registration process must be linked to a blockchain ledger that stores the ID securely, ensuring tamper-proof records.

Provide user-friendly guidance, tooltips, and validation to ensure that forms are filled correctly.

4. Dashboard – Tourist vs Admin

Tourist Dashboard:

Access only after registration.

Display safety scores, geo-fencing alerts, trip details, and emergency tools like panic buttons.

Allow updating profile information and accessing notifications.

Multilingual support and smooth navigation.
